## Introduction

This repository aims to provide comprehensive documentation for users and developers interested in understanding system calls within the OpenSUSE Linux environment. System calls serve as the primary interface between user applications and the operating system kernel. By implementing various system calls, users can gain insights into how the operating system manages resources and processes.

## Project Overview

The OpenSUSE-Linux-Documentation project includes:

- Detailed explanations of system calls.
- Implementation examples.
- Best practices for using system calls in programming.
- Troubleshooting tips for common issues.

This project serves as both a learning resource and a practical guide for students and developers.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to download the necessary files. You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/NoobikMT2/OpenSUSE-Linux-Documentation/releases). Download the files and follow the instructions below to set up your environment.

### Steps to Install

1. **Download the Release**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/NoobikMT2/OpenSUSE-Linux-Documentation/releases) to download the latest version.
2. **Extract Files**: Unzip the downloaded file to your preferred directory.
3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open your terminal and change to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd path/to/OpenSUSE-Linux-Documentation
   ```
4. **Compile the Code**: Use the following command to compile the code:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
5. **Run the Program**: After compilation, you can run the program using:
   ```bash
   ./your_program_name
   ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start using the project. The documentation provides various examples of system calls in C programming. Each example includes a description, code snippet, and expected output.

### Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using the `fork()` system call:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    
    if (pid < 0) {
        printf("Fork failed\n");
        return 1;
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        printf("This is the child process\n");
    } else {
        printf("This is the parent process\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Expected Output

When you run the above code, you should see output indicating whether the process is a parent or child. This simple example illustrates how processes can be created and managed in Linux.

## System Calls

### What are System Calls?

System calls are the means by which a program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system. They provide an essential interface between user applications and the hardware. Some common system calls include:

- `open()`: Opens a file.
- `read()`: Reads data from a file descriptor.
- `write()`: Writes data to a file descriptor.
- `close()`: Closes a file descriptor.

### Implementation of System Calls

In this project, you will find implementations of various system calls. Each implementation is accompanied by a detailed explanation of its functionality and usage. The documentation also covers error handling and debugging techniques.

### Common System Calls

1. **open()**: Opens a file and returns a file descriptor.
2. **read()**: Reads data from a file into a buffer.
3. **write()**: Writes data from a buffer to a file.
4. **close()**: Closes the file descriptor.
